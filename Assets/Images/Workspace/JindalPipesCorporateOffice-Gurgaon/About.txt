The project entailed taking a completed building and designing the interiors for it with obvious constraints imposed on the interior architecture as the building design was done independently and with little provision for the intended and eventual use of the building. The building had a large out of scale central open space designed with little or no consideration of the obvious heat gain issues throughout the building. The central courtyard has a series of multi level air-conditioned terraces and event spaces.
