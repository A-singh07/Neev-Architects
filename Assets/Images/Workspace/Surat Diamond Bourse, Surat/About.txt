Client: Surat Diamond Bourse

Status: Under Construction

Size: 65,00,000 sq ft | 35 acres

The upcoming Surat Diamond Bourse will be seen as an exemplar for integrating high-density commercial architecture along with efficient climate-responsive design. At over 70 lakh sq. ft. of built up area, the Surat Diamond Bourse, will provide employment to over 1.5 lakh people. The enormity of the site posed the challenge to navigate large volumes of people through great distances.
The interior spaces are all planned ‘inside-out’, pushing the idea of modularity for resource optimization in terms of structure, and hence cost efficiencies. With over 4,500 offices of diamond traders, along with the state-of-the-art facilities that include safe deposit vaults, customs clearance house, world standard convention centre, exhibition centers, training centers, entertainment areas, restaurants and a club, the Surat Diamond Bourse is set to become the World’s Largest Single Office Building.
