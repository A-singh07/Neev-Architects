The Gran Carmen is a low-density niche luxury residential villa development comprising of over 120 villas spread across a 13acre site in the picturesque environs of the outskirts of Bengaluru. Morphogenesis saw this as an opportunity to develop a new prototype for Villas as an entity addressing issues of identity, livability, spatial configuration, environmental and social concerns. The building morphology has been derived as a result of climatic studies, which have aided in the detailing of the building skin and the landscape which is a crucial part of the project. The development has been designed as a pedestrianised community by creating an on-site grade separation and isolating all vehicular movement to the basement, adding to the accessibility and security of the complex.
