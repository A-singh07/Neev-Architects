The design brief was to create a new Urban Development on the Outskirts of the City-An Urban spread that allows for infinite possibility and flexibility yet defines the Academic Settlement. The Development is envisaged as a dense urban collage derived from its local climatic conditions. The planning process is a derivative of the definition of three main zones- Public Zone (Academic), Semi Public and Private Zone (Residential) and an overlay of these is a key Design determinant. The master plan aims to create a mini urban settlement which generates a sustainable Socio-Cultural Built environment similar to that of a City. Various morphologies were tested to achieve an optimum sense of balance of built and open space, suited to the space requirements.
