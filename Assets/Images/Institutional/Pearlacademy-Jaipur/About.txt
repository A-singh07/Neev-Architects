This project in Jaipur is geared towards creating an environmentally responsive, passive habitat. A radical fusion of traditional and contemporary architecture, the institute creates interactive spaces for a creative student body to work in multifunctional zones that blend the indoors with the outdoors seamlessly. Despite its compact, rectilinear external form, Pearl’s internal courtyard shapes provide a sense of perpetuity - a continuous and fluid space with no end.. The architecture of the institute is a confluence of modern adaptations of traditional Indo-Islamic architectural elements and passive-cooling strategies commonly used in Rajasthan’s desert climate, such as self-shading courtyards, water bodies, baolis (stepwell) and jaalis (perforated screens). The building is protected from the environment by a double skin, the ‘jaali’ which acts as a thermal buffer between the building and its surroundings. It reduces direct heat gain through articulated fenestrations and serves the function of three filters - air, light, and privacy.
